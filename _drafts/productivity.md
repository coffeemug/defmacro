title:  "Personal productivity"

This post describes my personal productivity system. It works pretty
well for me, but may not for you. Some parts of it are based on
observations I made about myself that may not apply to you. Other
parts could probably be adapted to anyone because they're based on
observations I think are objectively true about the world. As always
with these things, take what works, throw out what doesn't. This isn't
meant to be prescriptive.

# Being on top of things

The first observation is that there are two classes of tasks,
__intrinsic__ and __extrinsic__. Intrinsic tasks come from my own mind
and usually make me happy. Working on the stuff _I want to work on_ is
easy and fun, so it doesn't really present a problem. Extrinsic tasks
come from other people or the bureaucratic system, and mostly make me
miserable. Working on extrinsic tasks means I'm working on other
people's agendas. Sometimes it's not even people, but an automated
semi-human system that doesn't have capacity to care whether the tasks
get done or not.

Learning to deal with extrinsic tasks is 99% of the productivity
battle. Here is what I do.

__First__, I use a single centralized system to keep track of all
extrinsic tasks. For me, that's e-mail.

__Second__, I never agree to do anything that tasks more than thirty
seconds. Here is what I say instead (in person, over Slack, etc.):

> I'm working on something right now and can't commit to doing
  this. Could you send me an e-mail and I'll see if I can get to it?
