title:  "Personal productivity"

This post describes my personal productivity system. It works pretty
well for me, but may not for you. Some parts of it are based on
observations I made about myself that may not apply to you. Other
parts could probably be adapted to anyone because they're based on
observations I think are objectively true about the world. As always
with these things, take what works, throw out what doesn't. This isn't
meant to be prescriptive.

# Being on top of things

The first observation is that there are two classes of tasks,
__intrinsic__ and __extrinsic__. Intrinsic tasks come from my own mind
and usually make me happy. Working on the stuff _I want to work on_ is
easy and fun, so it doesn't really present a problem. Extrinsic tasks
come from other people or the bureaucratic system, and mostly make me
miserable. Working on extrinsic tasks means I'm working on other
people's agendas. Sometimes it's not even people, but an automated
semi-human system that doesn't have capacity to care whether the tasks
get done or not. Learning to deal with extrinsic tasks is 99% of the
productivity battle. Here is what I do.

__First__, I use e-mail as a single centralized system to keep track
of all extrinsic tasks, and never immediately agree to do anything
that takes more than thirty seconds. Instead, I politely ask people to
e-mail me the task (having a template that's a keystroke away helps):

> I'm working on something right now and can't commit to doing
  this. Could you send me an e-mail and I'll see if I can get to it?

If something extrinsic comes up that I myself think I need to do (like
filling out some HR form), I don't do it -- I send myself an e-mail
instead.

__Second__, I process e-mail no more than twice a day -- in the
morning and in the evening (I could probably get away with doing it
only once, but I haven't tried that yet).

For each e-mail I use a single test to determine if I should work on
it: _is my involvement likely to make the world look materially
different a month from now?_ If the answer is no, I politely inform
people I won't work on the task and try to give a helpful suggestion
on how they could accomplish it without me.

In practice it means I'll only take on extrinsic tasks if their impact
will be felt months or years into the future. Here are examples of
tasks that pass my test:

- Closing a candidate or a high value customer
- Coaching people
- Deciding on a programming language for a project
- Bureaucratic tasks that involve large or escalating penalties
- Helping design a product feature

Here are examples of tasks that don't pass my test:

- Vendor selection
- Filling out status spreadsheets
- Requests to write something up
- Reviewing most decisions
- Editing SEO content

Note that I'm not suggesting you need such a high bar for _everything_
you do, just that you can usually get away with having such a high bar
for extrinsic tasks that you _don't want_ to do. For me prioritization
only gets difficult if I fail to properly filter extrinsic demands (or
to put it more bluntly, task management is only a problem when other
people or systems waste my time).

__Third__, I have a label in gmail called `later`, and at the end of
each batch I move all left-over e-mail in my inbox into that
label. Then I let the `later` label grow infinitely and never look at
it again unless the e-mail reappears in my inbox. This trick
eliminates the cognitive burden associated with having latent e-mail
in my inbox, and eliminates tasks that people don't need me to do
*that* badly (because if they did, they'd e-mail me again).

# Meetings

A large portion of your e-mail will likely be requests for
meetings. Meetings come in two varieties -- __networking__ (e.g. let's
grab coffee and see what happens), and __procedural__ (e.g. the Monday
morning sprint meeting).

My personal view on networking/area-of-luck meetings (and conferences)
is that they're amplifiers of your work. If you're doing something
important, you'll have lots of interesting and productive meetings. On
the other hand, if your work is mediocre, meetings will drain your
energy and will go nowhere. To make this more concrete, if you
invented oculus rift and there is a 30m line to your booth packed with
people who can't wait to try it, you'll have a lot more fun than if
you invented yet another sleep tracking sensor and all you get is an
occassional lost soul asking for directions to the bathroom.

So important work comes first. I ask myself: _how likely is this
person/audience to be giddy about my work?_ Unless the answer is "very
likely", I politely turn the meeting down (via a template shortcut):

> Thanks for thinking of me, but I decided to be a bit reclusive and
  focus on doing uninterrupted work for the next six months.
