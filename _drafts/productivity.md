title:  "Personal productivity"

This post describes my personal productivity system. It works pretty
well for me, but may not for you. Some parts of it are based on
observations I made about myself that may not apply to you. Other
parts could probably be adapted to anyone because they're based on
observations I think are objectively true about the world. As always
with these things, take what works, throw out what doesn't. This isn't
meant to be prescriptive.

# Being on top of things

The first observation is that there are two classes of tasks,
__intrinsic__ and __extrinsic__. Intrinsic tasks come from my own mind
and usually make me happy. Working on the stuff _I want to work on_ is
easy and fun, so it doesn't really present a problem. Extrinsic tasks
come from other people or the bureaucratic system, and mostly make me
miserable. Working on extrinsic tasks means I'm working on other
people's agendas. Sometimes it's not even people, but an automated
semi-human system that doesn't have capacity to care whether the tasks
get done or not. Learning to deal with extrinsic tasks is 99% of the
productivity battle. Here is what I do.

__First__, I use a single centralized system to keep track of all
extrinsic tasks. For me, that's e-mail. I have a label in gmail called
`incoming` along with an automatic filter that labels each new e-mail
as `incoming` and archives it. That's right, all new e-mail bypasses
the inbox. There is a cognitive burden I don't entirely understand
with having e-mail in my inbox that disappears entirely when I use a
label instead. Probably because I have some unshakable internal
expectation that I should process everything in my inbox, where as a
label can grow infinitely without causing me any apprehension.

I process the `incoming` label no more than twice a day -- in the
morning and in the evening. I could probably get away with doing it
only once, but I haven't tried that yet.

__Second__, I never immediately agree to do anything that takes more
than thirty seconds. Here is what I say instead (in person, over
Slack, etc.):

> I'm working on something right now and can't commit to doing
  this. Could you send me an e-mail and I'll see if I can get to it?

If something extrinsic comes up that I myself think I need to do (like
filling out some HR form), I don't do it -- I send myself an e-mail
instead.

__Third__, when I do process the `incoming` label I use a single test
to determine if I should work on each task: _is my involvement likely
to make the world look materially different a month from now?_ If the
answer is no, I politely inform people I won't work on the task and
try to give a helpful suggestion on how they could accomplish it
without me.

In practice it means I'll only take on extrinsic tasks if their impact
will be felt months or years into the future. Here are examples of
tasks that pass my test:

- Closing a candidate or a high value customer
- Coaching people
- Deciding on a programming language for a project
- Bureaucratic tasks that involve large or escalating penalties
- Helping design a product feature

Here are examples of tasks that don't pass my test:

- Vendor selection
- Filling out status spreadsheets
- Requests to write something up
- Reviewing most decisions
- Editing SEO content

Note that I'm not suggesting you need such a high bar for _everything_
you do, just that you can usually get away with having such a high bar
for extrinsic tasks that you _don't want_ to do. For me prioritization
only gets difficult if I fail to properly filter extrinsic demands (or
to put it more bluntly, task management is only a problem when other
people or systems waste my time).

# Meetings

A large portion of your e-mail will likely be requests for
meetings. Meetings come in two forms -- __networking__ (e.g. let's
grab coffee and see what happens), and __procedural__ (e.g. the Monday
morning sprint meeting).

My personal view on networking/area-of-luck meetings (and conferences)
is that they're amplifiers of your work. If you're doing something
important, you'll ave lots of fun meeting people. On the other hand,
if your work is mediocre, meetings will go nowhere. So important work
comes first.
