title:  "Personal productivity"
---

My personal productivity system evolved around the observation that
there are two classes of tasks, intrinsic and extrinsic. Intrinsic
tasks come from my own mind and mostly make me happy. I usually have
no problem prioritizing intrinsic tasks, and enjoy working on
them. Extrinsic tasks come from somewhere else -- other people, the
bureaucratic system, the Combine! -- and working on them typically
makes me miserable.
