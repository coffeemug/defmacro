title:  "Why startups fail"
---

There is a lot of cultural wisdom on why startups fail. No one wants
the product. The market is tiny. The team is bad. The economics
don&#8217;t work out. You run out of cash.

All of that is true. But it&#8217;s the effect, not the cause.

There are two root causes for failing startups people don&#8217;t
often talk about. You know something&#8217;s wrong but don&#8217;t
know what to do about it, or you know something&#8217;s wrong, know
what to do about it, but don&#8217;t do it because you&#8217;re
afraid.<sup>1</sup>

About 95% of mistakes I made in the first two years of founding a
startup fell into the latter category. Getting past these early fears
was extremely hard on me emotionally and took a very long time. But in
hindsight, developing the courage to do what I know is right was one
of the best things about starting up.

I still make as many mistakes as ever, but now it&#8217;s because I
don&#8217;t have the know-how. I hate these mistakes &#8212; they
drive me nuts. But I no longer hate myself. Failing because I
didn&#8217;t know better? I can live with that. Failing because I knew
what needed to get done but didn&#8217;t have the courage to do it?
That will sting for a long, long time.

Look at some startup questions on Quora:

The authors already know what&#8217;s wrong and what to do. But
they&#8217;re not doing it. Doing what you know to be right can be
very, very hard.
  
Everyone needs some time to work up the courage. That&#8217;s ok. Just
try not to take years. The sooner you face your fears, the sooner you
get past them. It&#8217;s the only way to get a real chance to break
into the big leagues.

_<sup>1</sup> One other possibility is not knowing something&#8217;s wrong, but mistakes like these are very rare. Startup founders are usually so paranoid they can sense problems from a thousand miles away._
