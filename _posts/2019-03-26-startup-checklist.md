title:  "Startup idea checklist"
---

I've been tinkering with different startup ideas and needed a good
checklist to think through them. There are great templates for this
already: [The YC application][], Amazon's [internal press release][],
and Sequoia's [Writing a Business Plan][]. I found myself mixing and
tweaking these templates because they don't exactly match my model of
the world, so I wrote up my own list.

[The YC application]: https://apply.ycombinator.com/
[internal press release]: https://www.quora.com/What-is-Amazons-approach-to-product-development-and-product-management/answer/Ian-McAllister
[Writing a Business Plan]: https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/writing-a-business-plan/
[Zero to One]: https://www.amazon.com/Zero-Notes-Start-Ups-Build-Future/dp/0753555190/

I use this list both to develop ideas and filter them. If you adopt
it, be careful about using it as a filter. Remember that in the early
stages, good ideas are very easy to kill.

# Product

1. What are you building?
   <br/><span class="annotation"><= 70 chars</span>
   <br/><span class="annotation">[@sama][]: "it's easy/fun to say
   every new startup you hear about is bad. you will usually be right.
   you will never be successful."</span>
1. Who is it for?
   <br/><span class="annotation"><= 70 chars</span>
1. What's the essence of their pain? If they read this answer, would
   they say "thanks, I wish I’d thought of putting it that way”?
   <br/><span class="annotation"><= 240 chars</span>
   <br/><span class="annotation">[@benedictevans][]: "The iTunes Store
   solved a user problem. So did the App Store. And so did Spotify and
   Apple Music, and indeed Apple News. But what user problem is solved
   by Apple’s commissioning TV shows?"</span>
1. Write a tweet from a hypothetical customer explaining the product
   and how it alleviates their pain.
   <br/><span class="annotation">[@BrianNorgard][]: No one cares
   about your product. Who built it, its features, the origin story —
   it’s all superfluous. People only find value in what your product
   can do for them right now. Save people time. Save people money.
   Give people an escape. The selfish hand will always govern.</span>
1. Write a blog post title for your product launch. Is it
   surprising? Is it new? Will your target customers want to click on
   it? Will they want to share the link? Will they still share it the
   next day?
   <br/><span class="annotation"><= 70 chars</span>
1. Write the first paragraph of your product announcement blog post.
   Include the product name, an explanation of what the product is,
   the target market, the main benefit, and the call to action.
   <br/><span class="annotation"><= 240 chars</span>
1. What "metrics of goodness" do your target customers care about? Is
   your product qualitatively better on these metrics than every
   available alternative?
