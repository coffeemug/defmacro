title:  "57 startup lessons"
---

There are already very good lists of startup lessons written by really
talented, experienced people
(<a href="http://betashop.com/post/32913573235/90-things-ive-learned-from-founding-4-technology">here</a>
and <a href="http://blog.samaltman.com/startup-advice">here</a>). I&#8217;d
like to add another one. I learned these lessons the hard way in the
past four years. If you&#8217;re starting a company, I hope you have
an easier path.

# People

1. If you can&#8217;t get to ramen profitability with a team of 2
   &#8211; 4 within six months to a year, something&#8217;s
   wrong. (You can choose not to be profitable, but it must be your
   choice, not something forced on you by the market).
1. Split the stock between the founding team evenly.
1. Always have a vesting schedule.
1. Make most decisions by consensus, but have a
   single <span class="caps">CEO</span> whose decisions are
   final. Make it clear from day one.
1. Your authority as <span class="caps">CEO</span> is earned. You
   start with a non-zero baseline. It grows if you have victories and
   dwindles if you don&#8217;t. Don&#8217;t try to use authority you
   didn&#8217;t earn.
1. Morale is very real and self-perpetuating. If you work too long
   without victories, your investors, employees, family, and you
   yourself will lose faith. Work like hell not to get yourself into
   this position.
1. Pick the initial team <strong>very</strong> carefully. Everyone
   should be pleasant to work with, have at least one skill relevant
   to the business they&#8217;re spectacular at, be extremely
   effective and pragmatic. Everyone should have product sense and a
   shared vision for the product and the company.
1. The standard you walk past is the standard you accept. Pick a small
   set of non-negotiable rules that matter to you most and enforce
   them ruthlessly.
1. Fire people that are difficult, unproductive, unreliable, have no
   product sense, or aren&#8217;t pragmatic. Do it quickly.
1. Some friction is good. Too much friction is deadly. Fire people
   that cause too much friction. Good job + bad behavior ==
   you&#8217;re fired.

# Fundraising

{:start="11"}
1. If you have to give away more than 15% of the company at any given
   fundraising round, your company didn&#8217;t germinate
   correctly. It&#8217;s salvageable but not ideal.
1. If you haven&#8217;t earned people&#8217;s respect yet, fundraising
   on traction is an order of magnitude easier than fundraising on a
   story. If you have to raise on a story but don&#8217;t have the
   reputation, something&#8217;s wrong.
1. Treat your fundraising pitch as a minimum viable product. Get it
   out, then iterate after every meeting.
1. Most investor advice is very good for optimizing and scaling a
   working business. Listen to it.
1. Most investor advice isn&#8217;t very good for building a magical
   product. Nobody can help you build a magical product &#8212;
   that&#8217;s your job.
1. Don&#8217;t fall in love with the fundraising process. Get it done
   and move on.

# Markets

{:start="17"}
1. The best products don&#8217;t get built in a vacuum. They win
   because they reach the top of a field over all other products
   designed to fill the same niche. Find your field and be the
   best. If there is no field, something&#8217;s wrong.
1. Work on a problem that has an immediately useful solution, but has
   enormous potential for growth. If it doesn&#8217;t augment the
   human condition for a huge number of people in a meaningful way,
   it&#8217;s not worth doing. For example, Google touches billions of
   lives by filling a very concrete space in people&#8217;s daily
   routine. It changes the way people behave and perceive their
   immediate physical surroundings. Shoot for building a product of
   this magnitude.
1. Starting with the right idea matters. Empirically, you can only
   pivot so far.
1. Assume the market is efficient and valuable ideas will be
   discovered by multiple teams nearly instantaneously.
1. Pick new ideas because they&#8217;ve been made possible by other
   social or technological change. Get on the train as early as
   possible, but make sure the technology is there to make the product
   be enough better that it matters.
1. If there is an old idea that didn&#8217;t work before and there is
   no social or technological change that can plausibly make it work
   now, assume it will fail. (That&#8217;s the efficient market
   hypothesis again. If an idea could have been brought to fruition,
   it would have been. It&#8217;s only worth trying again if something
   changed.)
1. Educating a market that doesn&#8217;t want your product is a losing
   battle. Stick to your ideals and vision, but respect trends. If you
   believe the world needs iambic pentameter poetry, sell hip hop, not
   sonnets.

# Products

{:start="24"}
1. Product sense is everything. Learn it as quickly as you can. Being
   good at engineering has nothing to do with being good at product
   management.
1. Don&#8217;t build something that already exists. Customers
   won&#8217;t buy it just because it&#8217;s yours.
1. Make sure you know why users will have no choice but to switch to
   your product, and why they won&#8217;t be able to switch
   back. Don&#8217;t trust yourself &#8212; test your assumptions as
   much as possible.
1. Ask two questions for every product feature. Will people buy
   because of this feature? Will people not buy because of lack of
   this feature? No amount of the latter will make up for lack of the
   former. Don&#8217;t build features if the answer to both questions
   is &#8220;no&#8221;.
1. Build a product people want to buy in spite of rough edges, not
   because there are no rough edges. The former is pleasant and highly
   paid, the latter is unpleasant and takes forever.
1. Beware of chicken and egg products. Make sure your product provides
   immediate utility.
1. Learn the difference between people who might buy your product and
   people who are just commenting. Pay obsessive attention to the
   former. Ignore the latter.

# Marketing

{:start="31"}
1. Product comes first. If people love your product, the tiniest
   announcements will get attention. If people don&#8217;t love your
   product, no amount of marketing effort will help.
1. Try to have marketing built into the product. If possible, have the
   YouTube effect (your users can frequently send people a link to
   something interesting on your platform), and Facebook effect (if
   your users are on the product, their friends will need to get on
   the product too).
1. Watch <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiro_Dreams_of_Sushi">Jiro
   Dreams of Sushi</a>, then do marketing that way. Pick a small set
   of tasks, do them consistently, and get better every day.
1. Reevaluate effectiveness on a regular basis. Cut things that
   don&#8217;t work, double down on things that do.
1. Don&#8217;t guess. Measure.
1. Market to your users. Getting attention from people who won&#8217;t
   buy your product is a waste of time and money.
1. Don&#8217;t say things if your competitors can&#8217;t say the
   opposite. For example, your competitors can&#8217;t say their
   product is slow, so saying yours is fast is sloppy marketing. On
   the other hand, your competitors <strong>can</strong> say their
   software is for Python programmers, so saying yours is for Ruby
   programmers is good marketing. Apple can get away with breaking
   this rule, you can&#8217;t.
1. Don&#8217;t use supercilious tone towards your users or
   competitors. It won&#8217;t help sell the product and will destroy
   good will.
1. Don&#8217;t be dismissive of criticism. Instead, use it to improve
   your product. Your most vocal critics will often turn into your
   biggest champions if you take their criticism seriously.

# Sales

{:start="40"}
1. Sales fix everything. You can screw up everything else and get
   through it if your product sells well.
1. Product comes first. Selling a product everyone wants is easy and
   rewarding. Selling a product no one wants is an unpleasant game of
   numbers.
1. Be relentless about working the game of numbers while the product
   is between the two extremes above. Even if you don&#8217;t sell
   anything, you&#8217;ll learn invaluable lessons.
1. Qualify ruthlessly. Spending time with a user who&#8217;s unlikely
   to buy is equivalent to doing no work at all.
1. Inbound is easier than outbound. If possible, build the product in
   a way where customers reach out to you and ask to pay.

# Development

{:start="45"}
1. Development speed is everything.
1. Minimize complexity. The simpler the product, the more likely you
   are to actually ship it, and the more likely you are to fix
   problems quickly.
1. Pick implementations that give 80% of the benefit with 20% of the
   work.
1. Use off the shelf components whenever possible.
1. Use development sprints. Make sure your sprints aren&#8217;t longer
   than one or two weeks.
1. Beware of long projects. If you can&#8217;t fit it into a sprint,
   don&#8217;t build it.
1. Beware of long rewrites. If you can&#8217;t fit it into a sprint,
   don&#8217;t do it.
1. If you must do something that doesn&#8217;t fit into a sprint, put
   as much structure and peer review around it as possible.
1. Working on the wrong thing for a month is equivalent to not showing
   up to work for a month at all.

# Company administration

{:start="54"}
1. Don&#8217;t waste time picking office buildings, accountants,
   bookkeepers, janitors, furniture, hosted tools, payroll companies,
   etc. Make sure it&#8217;s good enough and move on.
1. Take the time to find a good, inexpensive lawyer. It will make a
   difference.

# Personal well-being

{:start="56"}
1. Do everything you can not to attach your self esteem to your
   startup (you&#8217;ll fail, but try anyway). Do the best you can
   every day, then step back. Work in such a way that when the dust
   settles you can be proud of the choices you&#8217;ve made,
   regardless of the outcome.
1. Every once in a while, get away. Go hiking, visit family in another
   city, go dancing, play chess, tennis, <strong>anything</strong>. It
   will make you more effective and make the people around you
   happier.
