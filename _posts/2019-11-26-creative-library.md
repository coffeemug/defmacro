Around 2016 I ran a little experiment-- every time I ran into an
especially clever solution to a complex problem, I saved it on my
computer. In a few months I had about a dozen of these, and I noticed
that the solutions repeat a small set of techniques. So I categorized
each solution by technique, and gave every technique a name. At the
time of this writing I have a few hundred solutions saved, categorized
into 23 techniques.

Many of these techniques can be mixed and matched. When I run into a
tricky problem, I go through the list of techniques and see if I can
apply any to my problem. Since many of the techniques can be combined,
I do this repeatedly until I can't. More often than not this process
results in an elegant solution to the problem, or at least a promising
start.

When I share my approaches to these problems, people often say "that's
clever! How did you possibly think of that?" Simple! I just go through
my list of techniques.

Over the next few months I'll write up the techniques and link to them
here, so this page can act as an index. Subscribe via [rss][] or
[twitter][] to see the techniques as I post them, or just check back
to this page.
