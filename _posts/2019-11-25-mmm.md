title: The mundane, the mystical, and the meta
---

In [craftsman, executive][] I wrote about two modes of working adapted
to different circumstances:

If you're a craftsman learning to operate in _executive mode_,
everything you study will fall into one of three broad categories--
_the mundane, the mystical, and the meta_. This is important because
unlike _craftsman mode_, you study _executive mode_ breadth first. For
example, you learn to program by picking a programming language, then
going deep until you master it. But you don't get good at _executive
mode_ by learning everything there is to know about Steve Jobs.

So you have to approach studying _executive mode_ breadth first. And
to do that, you need to understand what the categories are.

<p style="text-align: center;">&#1805;</p>

First there is __the mundane__. The mundane is conventional operations
techniques used in modern organizations-- roughly everything you can
outsource to a competent, well-incentivized professional CEO and
expect good outcomes. Some of these techniques, like productivity and
management, are applicable to executive mode in general. Others
are domain specific. Here is an example from Jason Lemkin's
[SaaStr][]:

> drive up NPS. How to increase pricing. How to sell more of a
> solution. How to compete. How to get more referrals, and increase
> revenue retention.

The mundane doesn't mean unimportant. A lot of people screw this up--
it's very, very important. It's the nuts and bolts of the operation.
If you want to work in executive mode, you have to get good at least
at some of these things. To do that you study this: [1][mundane_1]
[2][mundane_2] [3][mundane_3] [4][mundane_4].

[mundane_2]: https://www.amazon.com/High-Output-Management-Andrew-Grove/dp/0679762884/
[mundane_3]: https://www.saastr.com/best-of-saastr/
[mundane_4]: https://search.firstround.com/topics

Then there is __the mystical__. The mystical goes something like this. Yes, the mundane is very
important, and yes, conventional wisdom will get you far. But nobody
seriously believes that tips on structuring your calendar, going
upmarket or driving NPS will get you smart phones, or internet search,
or personal computers. That kind of innovation is something else
entirely. We know that given the right conditions entrepreneurs will
create these products, but we only have a rough idea of what the
conditions are. We don't know yet how to reliably teach or replicate
this.

So you read about exceptional projects and people, hoping to learn by
osmosis. Reading the mystical is like reading history, or classics.
You don't read Symposium because the information is applicable to your
life. You read it to learn to think like Socrates did. The mystical
includes biographies, case studies, memos and even lore:
[1][mystical_1] [2][mystical_2] [3][mystical_3] [4][mystical_4]. When
people take the mystical too far, they cargo cult Mark Zuckerberg's
flip-flops, or Steve Jobs's acid trips.

[mystical_2]: https://www.amazon.com/Empires-Light-Edison-Westinghouse-Electrify/dp/0375758844/
[mystical_3]: https://sriramk.com/memos
[mystical_4]: https://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?story=Real_Artists_Ship.txt

Finally there is __the meta__. The meta is an attempt to extract
useful models from the mundane and the mystical to try and teach
exceptionalism (or at least explain it post factum). Reading the meta
won't teach you how to hire a head of engineering or how open-source
business models work; but it _will_ give you tools at a higher level
of abstraction to reason through these problems on your own. For
example, how do you decide when to follow conventional wisdom and when
to be contrarian? One possible answer to this question is to [prefer
contrarian questions][]. That's one example of meta. Here are a few
more: [1][meta_1] [2][meta_2] [3][meta_3] [4][meta_4].

<p style="text-align: center;">&#1805;</p>

Most people, when they begin studying the executive mode, gravitate
toward one of the three categories to the exclusion of everything
else. If you tend pragmatic you'll likely restrict yourself to the
mundane-- what use is knowledge that doesn't immediately help build
products and close customers? If you tend intellectual you'll likely
restrict yourself to the meta-- why read about a million details when
you can learn the rules and figure out the details yourself from first
principles?

That's a mistake. Each category teaches you different _kinds_ of
things.

You _can't_ figure out the mundane from first principles any more than
you can figure out how to be a chess grandmaster from learning the
rules. There is too much to learn, and not enough time. You need the
knowledge others have painstakingly developed to go about your daily
work. The mystical teaches you to think big, and gives you the courage
to follow through on these thoughts. Humans are unusually good at
learning by imitation; the mystical gives you the opportunity to
imitate the best of humanity-- people you may not have access to, or
who may not even be alive. The meta enhances your ability to
understand and to think independently. It gives you the ability to
manipulate your idiosyncratic situation using higher order
intellectual tools.

If we flatten the categories, there is productivity, management,
domain-specific tactics, biographies, case studies, memos, lore, and
meta reasoning. At the beginning-- especially at the beginning--
sample from them uniformly. Or at the very least, don't neglect any
one group.
