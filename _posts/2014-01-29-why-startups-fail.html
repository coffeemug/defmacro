<h1>Why startups fail</h1>
<p class="meta">29 Jan 2014</p>
<p>There is a lot of cultural wisdom on why startups fail. No one wants the product. The market is tiny. The team is bad. The economics don&#8217;t work out. You run out of cash.</p>
<p>All of that is true. But it&#8217;s the effect, not the cause.</p>
<p>There are two root causes for failing startups people don&#8217;t often talk about. You know something&#8217;s wrong but don&#8217;t know what to do about it, or you know something&#8217;s wrong, know what to do about it, but don&#8217;t do it because you&#8217;re afraid.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>About 95% of mistakes I made in the first two years of founding a startup fell into the latter category. Getting past these early fears was extremely hard on me emotionally and took a very long time. But in hindsight, developing the courage to do what I know is right was one of the best things about starting up.</p>
<p>I still make as many mistakes as ever, but now it&#8217;s because I don&#8217;t have the know-how. I hate these mistakes &#8212; they drive me nuts. But I no longer hate myself. Failing because I didn&#8217;t know better? I can live with that. Failing because I knew what needed to get done but didn&#8217;t have the courage to do it? That will sting for a long, long time.</p>
<p>Look at some startup questions on Quora:</p>
<p>- <a href="http://www.quora.com/Startups/Should-I-step-down-My-CEO-cofounder-hasnt-brought-any-funding-nor-real-customers">Should I step down? My <span class="caps">CEO</span> cofounder hasn&#8217;t brought any funding, nor real customers?</a><br />
- <a href="http://www.quora.com/Startups/How-do-I-tell-my-cofounder-that-I-dont-think-he-is-suited-to-be-a-cofounder">How do I tell my cofounder that I don&#8217;t think he is suited to be a cofounder?</a><br />
- <a href="http://www.quora.com/India/Need-help-with-dealing-a-very-lazy-and-reckless-employee">Need help with dealing a very lazy and reckless employee?</a><br />
- <a href="http://www.quora.com/Management/How-do-you-deal-with-reckless-employees">How do you deal with reckless employees?</a></p>
<p>The authors already know what&#8217;s wrong and what to do. But they&#8217;re not doing it. Doing what you know to be right can be very, very hard.</p>
<p>Everyone needs some time to work up the courage. That&#8217;s ok. Just try not to take years. The sooner you face your fears, the sooner you get past them. It&#8217;s the only way to get a real chance to break into the big leagues.</p>
<p><br />
<i><sup>1</sup> One other possibility is not knowing something&#8217;s wrong, but mistakes like these are very rare. Startup founders are usually so paranoid they can sense problems from a thousand miles away.</i></p>
